Tumor Mycombiome Metagenome Project

Processing and taxonomically classifying fungal bins

This dataset supports the manuscript: Narunsky-Haziza, Sepich-Poore, Livyatan et al. Pan-cancer analyses reveal cancer type-specific fungal ecologies and bacteriome interactions.

The data and analysis in this repository reflect phylogenomic and sequence analyses of the fungal metagenome-assembled genome bins and their taxonomic classifications.
